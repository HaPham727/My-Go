# ⚫⚪️My-Go 
A WIP, light-weight game simulator for Go/Weiqi/Baduk/Cờ Vây programmed in the C++ language. This project is rendered using the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) C++ library.

## 🌟Features
- Render Go/Weiqi/Baduk/Cờ Vây board at sizes 19x19, 13x13, and 9x9.
- Use left mouse clicks to place Black and White pieces in alternating order.
- Dead/surrounded groups of pieces are automatically removed from the board.
- A Game End screen with option to play again pops up after 2 consecutive passes.

## ✨Plans
- Add scoring (most likely under Chinese rules).
- Add app icon.
